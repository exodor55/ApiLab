#Example 05 - Global Warming Masking

The fifth example showcases how whole screen masking could be used with pixi. 

It showcases how elements, sprites and images can be hidden and revealed through user interaction. This specific example showcases how an entire image can be masked, and slowly deleted/revealed through a brush. The user can erase the previous picture to reveal a picture underneath. The relevance this has to the designer is that the designer can artificially hide parts of their website and make them playful and fun to reveal through user interaction. 

This example was not created for the presentation. Purely to showcase PixiJS capabilities.
