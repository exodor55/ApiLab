The current example shows how an image could be easily animated with javascript. The bee and the rectangle behind it are constantly changing shape and size in a limited range. By clicking the bee the spinning image presents its full size and two other bigger images are showing up behind it. However, background image is spinning in reverse. The interaction is decribed in the left down corner in the example. Moreover, the floating bee disappears, when reaches the end of the screen and is available to be seen only if the page is reloaded. Therefore, I have added a onClick button, which basically reloads the page in order to refresh the floating bee.
