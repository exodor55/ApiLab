#Example 01 - Ant Queen and Workers

The first exmaple showcases an ant queen in the middle, and worker ants around the queen. 

The example shows various features and quirks of pixi.js when it comes to interactive 2d graphics. It shows how images, in this case ant sprites, can be easily placed on a viewable canvas. The interactivity comes in various forms through the ants. The ant queen, the ant in the middle, can be resized and rotated either left or right by mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts. For example, holding the alt key while clicking on the ant queen increases the image size and rotates it to the right. The worker ants, which are randomly placed on the canvas, are also interactive where the user can select, drag and drop them on designated areas. 

In general, it is an example showing how static images can be manipulated through user inputs.
