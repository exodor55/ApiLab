This example shows that an image can be easily animated and made interactive. Although, by adding one more differently interactive image I created a simple version of a game. The example has purpose of putting the beard properly on Putin. The code represents a big size image of Putin, which is centered on the canvas and the screen. The image is rotating independently by function delta. Then I have added an event listener of the key "Z" for indicating alert message, which makes the image of putin stop rotating, so as putin is staying adequately still and the beard to be fixed by eye from the user. The beard image is over the Putin image, which I have made to be able to change and use it's velocity to make it move with the keyboard arrow keys. And thus are added eventListeners.
